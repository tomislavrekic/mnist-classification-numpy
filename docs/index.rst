Welcome to MNIST Classification with NumPy's documentation!
===========================================================

Overview
--------

MNIST Classification with NumPy is an educational project that provides a hands-on
exploration of deep learning concepts using the MNIST dataset.
This project aims to demonstrate the implementation of a neural network for classifying handwritten
digits using the popular MNIST dataset, all achieved using just NumPy.



Key Features
------------

- **NumPy Implementation:** The entire project is built using the NumPy library, offering a clear and concise implementation of neural network components for educational purposes.

- **MNIST Dataset:** The project uses the MNIST dataset, a widely used benchmark for handwritten digit recognition tasks in the field of machine learning.

- **Model Architecture:** The neural network architecture is quite basic consisting of components such as dense layers, dropout, and activation functions.

Installation
------------

The installation section (:ref:`installation`) provides detailed instructions on setting up the project environment.
It covers steps such as cloning the repository, creating a virtual environment, installing dependencies,
and downloading the MNIST dataset.

Usage
-----

The usage section (:ref:`usage`) is a guide on how to start using the project.
It walks users through data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The `main.py` script
is highlighted as the main entry point, offering a convenient way to execute the entire pipeline
from loading the dataset to evaluating the trained model.
