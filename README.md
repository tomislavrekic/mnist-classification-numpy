# MNIST Classification with NumPy

Welcome to the documentation for MNIST Classification with NumPy, an educational project designed to provide hands-on
exploration of deep learning concepts using the MNIST dataset.

More about the project in the [documentation](https://tomislavrekic.github.io/mnist-classification-numpy/).

## Overview

MNIST Classification with NumPy is an educational project demonstrating the implementation of a neural network for
classifying handwritten digits using the popular MNIST dataset, all achieved using NumPy.

## Key Features

- **NumPy Implementation:** The entire project is built using the NumPy library, offering a clear and concise
  implementation of neural network components for educational purposes.

- **MNIST Dataset:** The project uses the MNIST dataset, a widely used benchmark for handwritten digit recognition tasks
  in the field of machine learning.

- **Model Architecture:** The neural network architecture is quite basic, consisting of components such as dense layers,
  dropout, and activation functions.

## Installation

To set up the project environment, follow the [installation guide](https://tomislavrekic.github.io/mnist-classification-numpy/installation.html). It covers steps such as cloning the
repository, creating a virtual environment, installing dependencies, and downloading the MNIST dataset.

## Usage

The [usage guide](https://tomislavrekic.github.io/mnist-classification-numpy/usage.html) walks users through data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The `main.py` script
is highlighted as the main entry point, offering a convenient way to execute the entire pipeline from loading the
dataset to evaluating the trained model.
